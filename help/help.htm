<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Imgzoom_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires PHP ≥ 7.1.0 and CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0. Imgzoom_XH also requires the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> plugin; if that is not already installed (see <em>Settings</em>→<em>Info</em>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/imgzoom_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>imgzoom/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Imgzoom</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the Website. Go to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Imgzoom</code>.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Imgzoom_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Images that shall be displayed in an Imgzoom_XH viewer have to be placed in the image folder of CMSimple_XH (usually <code>userfiles/images/</code>) or in a subfolder thereof.</p>
<p>You can either link to the image viewer from the content or the template, or you can embed it in an Iframe. However, in either case you do not use the URL of the image directly, but instead request the image viewer:</p>
<pre><code>./?&amp;imgzoom_image=%IMAGE_FILENAME%</code></pre>
<p>An example: say you have the file <code>userfiles/images/scan.jpg</code>. To create a link, use the following URL:</p>
<pre><code>./?&amp;imgzoom_image=scan.jpg</code></pre>
<p>To embed an image viewer in a page write the following in HTML mode:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=&quot;./?&amp;imgzoom_image=scan.jpg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Adjust <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> according to your needs.</p>
<p>If the image to display is in a subfolder of the image folder, you have to add the subfolder in the URL, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>./?&amp;imgzoom_image=scans/image.jpg</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-viewer">The viewer</h3>
<p>On contemporary desktop browsers with JavaScript support the image will be resized to be shown completely when the image viewer is displayed. To zoom in, you have to click on the desired place; to zoom-out simply press the <code>SHIFT</code> key while clicking.</p>
<p>On older browsers and on browsers without JavaScript support the image will be displayed in its full size. You have to scroll to the desired section of the image. Zooming can be done with the controls of the browser for stand-alone viewers.</p>
<p>On mobile browsers you can use the customary pan, pinch-to-zoom and double tap gestures. Zooming will not generally work for embedded viewers, besides zoom-in with a long press.</p>

<p>Report bugs and ask for support either on <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/imgzoom_xh/issues">Github</a> or in the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>.</p>
